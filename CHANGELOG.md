## [Unreleased]

### Added

- ExecuTorch backend (`ANIRA_WITH_EXECUTORCH`, **enabled by default** like the other first-class backends — note it requires CMake ≥ 3.24 on desktop; pass `-DANIRA_WITH_EXECUTORCH=OFF` to build with an older CMake): runs `.pte` programs exported ahead-of-time with `torch.export` — PyTorch's edge/mobile inference stack. New `ExecuTorchProcessor` (`InferenceBackend::EXECUTORCH`) with per-instance `executorch::extension::Module`s, CPU execution delegated to XNNPACK (pinned to a single thread, like the other backends), file- and binary-buffer model loading, and `EXECUTORCH` support in the JSON config loader. Prebuilt static libraries are downloaded from the anira-project/backends release for all desktop platforms plus Android/iOS; desktop wires through ExecuTorch's own CMake package (requires CMake ≥ 3.24), mobile links the single merged archive. Covered by the GuitarLSTM inference tests and a new `minimal-executorch` example. All bundled model configs carry `EXECUTORCH` entries backed by `.pte` exports: SimpleGainNetwork (header and JSON, models from anira-project/example-models), the steerable-nafx CNN variants and the stateful LSTM (exported with mutable state buffers at a fixed 2048-sample chunk). The advanced and cnn-size benchmarks include the `EXECUTORCH` backend (the stateful RNN is excluded there since its fixed-chunk export cannot follow the varying buffer size), and the JUCE and CLAP example plugins offer `EXECUTORCH` in their backend selectors. Desktop CI builds and tests the backend; mobile CI keeps it off until the merged mobile archives are validated on-device. In fully static builds ExecuTorch is auto-disabled when LiteRT or TFLite is enabled (each bundles its own XNNPACK, whose symbols collide in one static image).

### Changed

- Default backends release tag bumped from v2.1.1 to v2.2.0 (adds the ExecuTorch 1.3.1 archives; other engine versions unchanged).

## [v2.2.1] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Batched overlapping-window extraction: a `pop_samples_from_buffer(...)` overload that extracts `num_batches` windows in one native call (also exposed to WebAssembly/TS), avoiding per-batch JS↔Wasm boundary crossings for batched/windowed models (e.g. HybridNN/GuitarLSTM).
- `PrePostProcessor::before_inference()` / `after_inference()` hooks, run on the inference thread right before/after the backend runs, letting stateful models (e.g. recurrent hidden-state feedback) splice state between consecutive inferences when combined with `session_exclusive_processor = true`. Wired up end-to-end in Anira Web (`registerPrePostProcessor`/`beforeInference()`/`afterInference()` on the TS side).
- Configurable inference-thread wait strategy: `anira::WaitStrategy { SpinBackoff, Blocking }` on `ContextConfig`. `Blocking` lets idle inference threads sleep on a semaphore instead of spin-polling, eliminating idle CPU usage at effectively no throughput cost; coerced to `SpinBackoff` with a warning on WebAssembly.
- Real-time factor and underrun reporting in the benchmark fixture (per-iteration RTF/`[underrun]` marker, plus an optional summary line with `rtf_mean`/`rtf_max`/underrun count).
- The `advanced` and `cnn-size` benchmarks now also cover the `CUSTOM` (no-inference) backend, and the benchmark CI workflow builds with tests enabled and runs the benchmark gtest suites.
- Configurable log level: `anira::LogLevel { Debug, Info, Warning, Error }` on `ContextConfig`, gating anira's own logging and forwarded to the ONNX Runtime, LiteRT and LibTorch backends (TFLite excepted — no runtime logging control in that prebuilt library). Defaults to `Info` in debug builds, `Error` in release builds.
- Anira version mismatch reporting in `Context::get_instance`: a differing major version between sessions is now reported as an error, a differing minor/patch as a warning.
- `Context::get_num_inference_threads()` / `InferenceHandler::get_num_inference_threads()`: number of inference threads currently active process-wide (also exported to WASM).

### Changed

- `ContextConfig`'s default `num_threads` is now platform-dependent: half the available CPU cores (as before) on native builds, `0` on WebAssembly, since inference threads there are always supplied externally via `AniraWeb.spinUpInferenceWorker()`.

### Fixed

- Stateful in-order dispatch (`session_exclusive_processor = true`) no longer allocates on the audio thread — `SessionElement`'s pending-dispatch queue is now pre-sized and fed through an explicit producer token.
- Web: the audio worklet now polyfills `performance.now()` before the WASM module loads, fixing a `ReferenceError` (observed in Firefox) whenever a blocking-ratio deadline was read from the audio thread.
- The advanced benchmark no longer instantiates ONNX Runtime for the stateful RNN model, whose fixed 2048-sample ONNX export failed warm-up at other buffer sizes.
- Use-after-free when a pooled backend processor outlived the session that created it — `InferenceConfig` is now owned per-processor instead of aliasing the originating session's copy.
- Windows build failure in `Context::get_instance()` caused by `<windows.h>`'s `min`/`max` macros mangling an unrelated `std::min(...)` call; fixed by defining `NOMINMAX`/`WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` before the include.
- Hardened `SessionElement::m_is_non_real_time` to `std::atomic<bool>` and unified the two `new_data_request()` wait paths onto one `wait_for_completion()` helper — previously a default-`blocking_ratio` session in non-real-time mode could free an in-flight buffer while the inference thread was still writing to it. Non-real-time mode also now works on WebAssembly once an inference worker is running.

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Android support** (`arm64-v8a` + `x86_64`): the library, the prebuilt backends, and the full gtest suite running on a KVM-accelerated emulator, all wired into CI (`build_test_mobile.yml`). The glibc-only `pthread_*inheritsched` / `pthread_setattr_default_np` calls are gated behind `!__ANDROID__` (bionic lacks them) while keeping the portable `SCHED_FIFO` path.
- **iOS support** (device + simulator): the library and prebuilt backends shipped as an xcframework, with the full gtest suite running on the simulator in CI. Per-SDK xcframework slice selection; TFLite is consumed as a `TensorFlowLiteC.framework` via a generated shim so anira's `<tensorflow/lite/...>` includes resolve untouched.
- **LiteRT inference backend** (`anira::InferenceBackend::LITERT`): runs `.tflite` models through Google's native `LiteRt*` C API / CompiledModel runtime. Enabled by default (`ANIRA_WITH_LITERT=ON`) as the modern TensorFlow-Lite-family backend; wired into the examples and benchmarks.
- Data-driven backend downloads: prebuilt backends are fetched at configure time from the [`anira-project/backends`](https://github.com/anira-project/backends) release, pinned by `ANIRA_BACKENDS_VERSION`.
- Live backend integrity check: when GitHub is reachable, anira fetches each asset's published SHA256 and re-downloads any backend whose archive changed upstream or downloaded incompletely, instead of a committed hash lock. `ANIRA_BACKENDS_SKIP_REMOTE_CHECK=ON` skips the remote query for offline/reproducible builds.
- Bring-your-own-backend knobs: `ANIRA_<ENGINE>_ROOTDIR` (prebuilt tree), `ANIRA_<ENGINE>_URL` + `ANIRA_<ENGINE>_SHA256` (custom source), and per-engine `ANIRA_<ENGINE>_LINKAGE=shared|static`.
- clang-tidy conformance across the library, tests and benchmark sources, enforced in CI via the `tanh-lab/ci-actions/clang-tidy-check` action (`clang_tidy.yml`)
- `InstallConsumer` smoke test that builds against the installed package to catch packaging regressions.
- Release pipeline now publishes every tested arch×linkage artifact with backend-consistent naming: Android (static), iOS (xcframework), and Linux/macOS/Windows × `shared`/`static`, including macOS `universal`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the `InferenceConfig::Defaults` compile-time constants were renamed from the `m_` prefix to the `k_` prefix to match the constant-naming convention (`m_warm_up` → `k_warm_up`, `m_session_exclusive_processor` → `k_session_exclusive_processor`, `m_blocking_ratio` → `k_blocking_ratio`). The mutable `Defaults::m_num_parallel_processors` is unchanged.
- LiteRT is now the default TensorFlow-Lite-family backend. The legacy TensorFlow Lite backend (the older `TfLite*` C API, `ANIRA_WITH_TFLITE`) is the **same runtime** exposed through a different C API, so the two are now **mutually exclusive** — enable the legacy path with `-DANIRA_WITH_LITERT=OFF -DANIRA_WITH_TFLITE=ON`.
- `nlohmann_json` is now consumed as a release download instead of a git submodule.
- CMake options and their validation were consolidated inline into `CMakeLists.txt` (`AniraOptions.cmake` and the redundant linkage knob were dropped).
- `anira::calculate_min` / `anira::calculate_max` are now `inline` free functions instead of `const auto` lambdas (source-compatible: existing call sites and uses as a callable are unaffected)
- The internal logging helper `isLoggingEnabled()` was renamed to `is_logging_enabled()`
- Migrated the shared clang configs (`.clang-format`/`.clang-tidy`/`.clangd`) from the `tanh-lib` submodule symlinks to [`tanh-tooling`](https://github.com/tanh-lab/tanh-tooling) (pinned `v0.1.4`): committed as real files, kept in sync by the `clang_check.yml` drift check, and the now-unused `tanh-lib` submodule was removed (configs are byte-identical, so lint/format results are unchanged)
- Adopted the default Claude Code config: `.claude/settings.json` now enables the `tanh-tools` plugin from the tanh-tooling marketplace (its format/lint/type-check hooks supersede the previous bespoke `.claude/hooks`)
- CI now covers Windows-`arm64`, Linux-`aarch64` and macOS-`universal` legs (shared + static) in addition to the mobile workflow.

### Fixed

- Potential use-after-free in `Buffer::malloc_channels()` when channel-pointer allocation fails
- Installed `nlohmann_json` config so `find_package(anira)` works against the installed package
- Disabled backends now compile to empty translation units (guarded `.cpp` bodies), and `minimal-onnxruntime` is self-sufficient in static builds
- Value-initialize the `const InferenceConfig` in the install consumer
- clang-tidy violations and a CLAP static MSVC runtime mismatch; preserve the anira-before-`JuceHeader` include order on MSVC; qualified `mem*` calls with `std::` and added `<cstring>`
- Windows shared-DLL copy, the examples target list, and arm64 LibTorch in CI
